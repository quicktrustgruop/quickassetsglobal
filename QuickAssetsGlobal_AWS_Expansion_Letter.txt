- EC2 Instances (P4d and G5) for powerful computing.
- S3 and Glacier for secure data storage and long-term archival.
- Lambda for automated smart contract execution and management.
- CloudWatch and Grafana for real-time monitoring and performance optimization.
- Global Accelerator for low-latency access to our mining operations worldwide.
Conclusion

We believe that AWS provides the perfect ecosystem to support our vision of large-scale,
decentralized mining operations. We are confident that with your infrastructure and support,
QuickAssetsGlobal will be able to set new standards in profitability, transparency, and innovation
within the mining sector.

We look forward to discussing this opportunity with you in more detail.
