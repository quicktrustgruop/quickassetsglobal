QuickAssetsGlobal - Institutional Mining Expansion Plan

Objective

Establish a massive, decentralized, interoperable computational and financial infrastructure with the
capacity to generate daily profits exceeding USD 400 million. This will be based on total multi-asset
mining, complete DeFi operations, market intelligence, institutional automation, and 100% auditable
compliance.
Full Hash Mining Zone (FHMZ)

- Mainstream Cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETHW, LTC, Monero, Zcash, Dogecoin, etc.
- Promising Altcoins: Kaspa, Flux, Ergo, Alephium, Neoxa, IronFish, etc.
- Stablecoins Mining via Liquidity Pools: USDT, USDC, DAI, etc.
- Memecoins and Community Projects: Shiba Inu, Pepe, Dogelon Mars, etc.
- Experimental Tokens and L2 Nodes Mining: zkApps, Polygon zkEVM nodes, etc.
Mining Software Stack (Multi-System)

- CPU/GPU/NVIDIA/AMD: Nanominer, Gminer, PhoenixMiner, T-Rex, etc.
- Cloud/FPGA/ASIC: ASICFarm, Hashcore, AwesomeMiner, MinerStat, Kadena Mining, AI Mining.
Automated & Intelligent Mining Framework

- HiveOS API, AWS Lambda for management.
- Automatic switching based on profitability.
- Auto-allocating hash power among coins by ROI.
- Security with temporary wallets and cold storage (AWS KMS).
- Pooling with failover: 2miners, F2Pool, HeroMiners, etc.
Processing Data Estimates

- 10,000+ GPUs A100 (AWS EC2 P4d and G5).
- 15,000+ vCPUs for XMR, ERGO, KASPA mining.
- 30+ software switches for 24/7 performance optimization.
- Global latency <30ms with AWS Global Accelerator.
- 20PB/month traffic with CloudWatch + Grafana monitoring.
Projected Mining Revenue (Per Day)

- Bitcoin + Litecoin: $8M - $15M
- Ethereum Forks: $10M - $25M
- Altcoins + Flux/Kaspa: $25M - $50M
- Memecoins + Pump Coins: $20M - $60M
- zk/L2 Tokens: $5M - $15M
- Stablecoin LP: $5M - $10M
- Yield Mining: $8M - $20M

Total Approximate Daily Revenue: $81M - $195M (Mining), $300M+ (with DeFi).
Full Compliance and Transparency

- 100% Logs stored in CloudTrail + S3 + Glacier (12-month retention).
- Smart contracts audited by Certik + ChainSecurity.
- AML/KYC through SumSub.
- Custom blockchain explorer for regulatory agencies.
- Verified pool and token whitelist.
